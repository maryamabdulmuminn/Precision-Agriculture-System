# Decentralized Precision Agriculture System (AgriDAO)

A blockchain-powered platform that combines IoT sensors, AI, and smart contracts to optimize agricultural operations through data-driven decision making.

## Overview

AgriDAO revolutionizes farming by creating a decentralized ecosystem where farm management, sensor data, crop predictions, and resource optimization work together seamlessly. The system enables farmers to make precise, data-driven decisions while maintaining complete control over their farm data.

## Core Components

### Farm Management Contract

The Farm Management Contract serves as the digital backbone for farm operations:

- Farm plot registration and mapping
- Crop rotation tracking and planning
- Soil health monitoring and history
- Weather impact assessment
- Yield tracking and reporting
- Equipment maintenance scheduling
- Worker activity logging

### Sensor Data Contract

The Sensor Data Contract processes and stores IoT sensor information:

- Real-time soil moisture monitoring
- Temperature and humidity tracking
- pH level measurements
- Nutrient content analysis
- Weather station integration
- Data validation and verification
- Historical data storage and retrieval
- Sensor calibration management

### Crop Prediction Contract

The Crop Prediction Contract leverages AI for agricultural forecasting:

- Yield prediction algorithms
- Optimal harvest time calculation
- Disease risk assessment
- Pest infestation prediction
- Weather impact modeling
- Market demand analysis
- Crop quality forecasting

### Resource Optimization Contract

The Resource Optimization Contract manages resource allocation:

- Smart irrigation scheduling
- Fertilizer application optimization
- Pest control management
- Energy usage monitoring
- Labor resource allocation
- Equipment utilization planning
- Waste reduction strategies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet with sufficient ETH
- IoT sensor network compatible with Web3
- Node.js v16.0.0 or higher
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- IPFS node for sensor data storage
- Compatible smart agriculture devices

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agri-dao.git
cd agri-dao
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

## Usage

### Registering a Farm Plot

```javascript
const farmManagement = await FarmManagementContract.deploy();
await farmManagement.registerPlot(
    coordinates,
    soilType,
    cropHistory,
    infrastructure
);
```

### Processing Sensor Data

```javascript
const sensorData = await SensorDataContract.deploy();
await sensorData.processSensorData(
    plotId,
    sensorType,
    reading,
    timestamp
);
```

### Generating Crop Predictions

```javascript
const cropPrediction = await CropPredictionContract.deploy();
await cropPrediction.generatePrediction(
    plotId,
    cropType,
    historicalData,
    weatherForecast
);
```
